# Visual-CLApp-Editor

Editor for the CLApp language giving the possibility of creating flow chart projects and export them to run them in a standalone mode.

CLApp can be seen as a script language but also as an actors language.

As it relies on java, it may easily interact with it by simply calling java methods. It can even add some byte code injection to those java classes before they will be called.

Therefore, the Editor needs the following Byte Code Engineering Library **BCEL-5.2.JAR** as well as the **CLAPP.JAR** to be able to run.
To run it, adapt the given shell to the location of your bcel, clapp and **VisualClappEditor** jars before typing the followingÂ :

_**bash starter.sh**_

or, under Windows,

_**starter.bat**_

With the Visual CLApp Editor you can create CLApp projects as well as, much more interesting, flow chart projects in an intuitive way.
